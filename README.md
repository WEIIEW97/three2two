# Optimizing 3D Convolutions via 2D Convolution Decomposition

## Overview

This document outlines a method to mimic 3D convolution operations using optimized 2D convolution primitives, reducing memory overhead and computational complexity while maintaining spatial-temporal feature extraction capabilities.

## Motivation

- **Memory Efficiency**: 3D conv kernels require O(k³) parameters vs O(k²) for 2D
- **Hardware Utilization**: Better compatibility with optimized 2D convolution libraries (cuDNN, MKL-DNN)
- **Computational Savings**: Reduced FLOPs for equivalent receptive fields
